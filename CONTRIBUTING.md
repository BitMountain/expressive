Please keep the following in mind:

- To match the existing code styling, use `npm run format` before committing code.
- Make sure the tests pass (run `npm test`). Your changes probably deserve new tests as well.

  versions of Node. On PR submission, a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/release-it/release-it/actions) will run the
  tests in multiple supported platforms and Node.js versions.
